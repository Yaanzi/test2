<h1>Human Life Cycle and Sexual Reproduction</h1>
<h3>Sexual reproduction</h3>
<p> - human combining genetic material from two different parents</p>
<h3>Fertilization</h3>
<p> - union of two sex cells</p>
<p> - actual fusion</p>
<h3>zygote (2n)</h3>
<p>must contain the correct number of chromosome in order to produce a healthy individual.</p>
<p> - diploid</p>
<p> - contains two set of chromosomes(mother) (father)</p>
<h2>Meiosis</h2>
<p> - results in the production of daughter cells containing half number of chromosomes of the parent cells.</p>
<p> - There are four daughter cells produced after one meiotic process because the cell divides twice in meiosis.</p>
<p> - The daughter cells after meiosis are not alike because of the manner the chromosomes divide.</p>
<p> - type of cell division used by multicellular organism in the formation of reproductive cells (gametes)</p>
<h3>sex cells (n)</h3>
<p>-haploid</p>
